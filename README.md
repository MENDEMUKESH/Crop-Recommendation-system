🌾 Crop Recommendation System using Machine Learning
📌 Overview
The Crop Recommendation System suggests the best crop to grow based on soil properties and environmental conditions. It uses machine learning algorithms to analyze NPK levels (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall to provide accurate crop recommendations.

✔️ Predicts the best crop based on soil and environmental factors.
✔️ Uses ML algorithms such as SVM, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
✔️ User-friendly interface for easy input and recommendations.
✔️ Dataset-driven analysis for precision farming.
